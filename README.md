# S-video-breakout-boards
PCBs used to create S-video breakout PCBs for various projects

Each PCB has solder side labeled and part number for the S-video connector.

One is for horizontal use.  For example removing an RF modulator from a computer or console and soldering your S-video connector there and then wiring directly from video processor.

One is for vertical use.  For example, drilling a hole in a plastic computer or console case and then soldering this PCB between the plastic and the computer/game console case.  Then you directly wire luma, chroma and ground from video processor.


Take the ZIP files to a PCB  manufacturer such as JLCPCB for fabrication.
